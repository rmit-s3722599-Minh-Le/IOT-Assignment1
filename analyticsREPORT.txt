We used two different Python Data Visualisation Libraries, Matplotlibrary and Seaborn, we chose these over others because,
Matplotlibrary has easily executable histogram charts, and Seaborn uses Matplotlibrary and simplies it and 
has more Visualisation types such as box plots which we decided on using.
While using these two we have decided on 2 graphs to show our data, one for the temperature and one for the humidity.
Since they both have different types of data (temperature in degrees and humidity in percentage) we decided to write a graph for 
each. in the temperature graph we decided to use a histogram plot to show the pattern of the temperature to help us analyze the 
data in a simpler way. for the humidity we chose to use boxplot as it shows the pattern of the humidity as well, but unlike the
histogram it also shows the mean as well as the range of the humidity and there for covering the percentage that is within the 
humidity range and also shows if there is any abnormalities outside the range. 

after using both Matplotlibrary and Seaborn they are pretty similar since Seaborn uses Matplotlibrary as its base and adds
simplification and more Visualisation plots on top of it. The difference between the two is that Seaborn uses less code and
easier to generate the plots. Seaborn also has more plots on it as said earlier there for giving you more options.
